# Hooks

niceform-hook exports all [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/useNiceForm) hooks, optimized to interact seamlessly with the niceform-hook context. 
Therefore, for them to work correctly, you need to use your form's context provider.


<ExampleUseForm/>
<ExampleUseFormState/>
<ExampleUseFieldState/>
<ExampleUseWatch/>

<hr/>

In addition to these hooks, there is the export of *useController*, however it has no significant effect on the form.
